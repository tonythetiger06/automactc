# AutoMacTC Changelog

## Main v. 1.0.0.5 (2019-04-12)

* Fixed bug with output debug log messages.
* Added some additional checks to pull hostname successfully.
* Added functionality to capture last known IP address from wifi.log off forensic images.
* Added exception handling if OSVersion can't be pulled from SystemVersion.plist successfully on a live system.
* Added handling for removing output files OR directories after successfully adding to the tar archive.
* Added handling for use of forensic mode against a mount point that wasn't successfully mounted (i.e. has none of the expected directories underneath).
* Added handling for exceptions thrown when we can't find OSVersion correctly on live or dead images. Also updated Safari, Quicklooks, and CoreAnalytics to account for the change. Now, if OSVersion can't be found, it will be marked and handled as None in comparison tests.
* Fixed a bug where the program would hang if it couldn't obtain the serial number. 
* Added ability to try to get last IP in forensic mode from wifi.log, including bz2 historical logs.

* Added argument to override the mount point error.
